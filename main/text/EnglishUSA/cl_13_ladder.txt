From: Deputy Reichsminister Ungeschickt
Subject: Ladder Safety Project Results

I am pleased to announce that since the implementation of Reichsminister Directive 174 - the mandatory introduction of safety cages for all ladders residing on military installations - our survey has shown an astonishing 75% reduction in ladder related injuries and fatalities.  I cannot begin to relate how important this statistic is in light of the current manpower shortage we are facing.

Let me caution all of you against lapsing into a false sense of complacency.  Only through your unwavering diligence can this project achieve such a continued level of success.

Deputy Reichsminister, Office of Industrial Safety, Berlin
