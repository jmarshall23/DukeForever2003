Subj: Special Issue Protective Eyewear

Shortly after the upgrading of the Mk XIVa Telemetric Console with the new, Version 2, Ultra-High-Contrast Electron Display Panel, there was a sudden influx of glaucoma-like symptoms reported by Telemetry Console Operators.  Although our studies indicate that these symptoms are temporary and, in most cases, of short duration, we are, nevertheless, issuing special ultraviolet protective eyewear to all console operators. Proper use of this eyewear should greatly reduce these instances of temporary visual impairment.
