I have incredible news.  Our team has just uncovered evidence of an even older burial site within the church ruins.  I believe this could actually be the Tomb of Olaric, fabled weaponsmith of Ancient Thule and founder of the Legion of the Dark Forge.  If this is the case, then contained within may be the long lost Dagger of Warding, one of the most coveted relics in all of Thulian lore.  What a glorious discovery this would be for all of us.
