What an amazing day this has been.  I can still hardly believe it.  The remains of the last Dark Knight have finally been discovered.  After all these years I feel totally vindicated.  What will Strasse and the other skeptics have to say now, I wonder?  Otto and I will be joining the advance team at the dig site.  We leave tomorrow morning on the first train.  With any luck we should be ready to begin the Life Essence Extraction by this time next week.  I must remember to pack an extra wool scarf.

Arrived this afternoon.  Travelling for two days straight. Everything finally unpacked.  Wave-guide on Number 2 Reduction Set damaged in transit.  Will have to cannibalize spare.  Colder than I expected, even for this time of year.

Conditions here are impossible.  Generators are unreliable and decent voltage regulation is non-existent.  Two days wasted on constant recalibrations.  I Hope we can make up the lost time.  Going to be close.  I feel my Bronchitis acting up.
