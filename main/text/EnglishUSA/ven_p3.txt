A flat dwell profile in the cam path holds the bolt locked briefly until the bullet has traveled past the muzzle and the pressure has dropped to a safe level.

Pins in the bolt head interface with the cam surfaces on the firing pin and cause the striker to rotate with the head.

After the extraction and ejection, the bolt has completed a 360-degree cycle and is positioned to pick up another round. All six bolts repeat this identical process in sequence.

Original Design Problems and Construction Notes:

The six barrels are held to the front of the rotor by an integral interrupted flange on one side of each barrel that requires a 180-degree turn for retention All of the barrels are prevented from rotating out of their retained positions by a barrel clamp which mates with four flanges on the front of each barrel. This clamp is held in place by a single bolt.
