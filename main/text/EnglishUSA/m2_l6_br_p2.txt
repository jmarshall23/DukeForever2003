^8Part 3: Crypt^8

According to Kreisau Circle members from Wulfburg, these catacombs run a great distance under the village, ultimately leading to an ancient church that is no longer accessible by normal means.  Helga von Bulow is reported to be there now, with a large contingent of her Elite Guard and a team of scientists from the SS Paranormal Division.  

Your orders are to navigate the catacombs and locate the church.  Gather any artifacts that you may find along the way for future analysis.  Kreisau Circle reports "supernatural" activities are taking place in the catacombs; these are most likely unfounded rumors, but they are from a reliable source and must be heeded.
