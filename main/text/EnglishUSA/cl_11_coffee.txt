From: Major Vorsichtig
Subject: Unauthorized use of equipment

Effective immediately, the practice of brewing coffee in the MkII Sequential Fuel Purifier is strictly forbidden.  As anyone who witnessed the events of last Thursday can attest, the presence of even the slightest impurities within the condenser vessel can lead to a violent chemical reaction.

Anyone found in violation of this policy will be dealt with in the harshest manner imaginable.

Major B. Vorsichtig
Acting Safety Officer
Reich Special Projects, Maintenance Div.
