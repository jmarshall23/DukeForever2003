^8Part 2: Paderborn Village^8

Paderborn, home to many of Germany's leading occultists, is currently hosting the elite of the SS Paranormal Division.  As learned in recently decoded SS transmissions, Marianna Blavatsky will perform a ritual termed "Anointing of the Dark Knights".  

The ceremony is scheduled to take place somewhere near Chateau Schufstaffel.  Resistance Intelligence tells us the only viable route into the chateau is through the village, as it is the least guarded path.  However, there is a General Alarm somewhere in the village near the chateau.  If the alarm is raised there will be no chance of getting inside.  You must, therefore, proceed through the village as quietly as possible, using your silenced weapons.

Also, with the "Anointing Ceremony" about to take place at the chateau, there are five key SS Paranormal Operatives residing in the Village.  This presents a unique opportunity to deliver a crippling blow to the SS Paranormal's chain of command.  Therefore, these SS Operatives must be eliminated before proceeding.
