To: All Specimen Caretakers
From: Hauptmann Shmutzig

The three cases of cholera reported in the outer guard compound have been, unequivocally, traced back to improper disposal of specimen waste materials.  In future, anyone found dumping specimen waste in the local water supply will be severely reprimanded.
