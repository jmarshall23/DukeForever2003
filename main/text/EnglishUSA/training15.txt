Exercise 15: The Mauser K98K long rifle

The Mauser K98K is the preferred long rifle of your enemy. This exercise will teach you how to employ it effectively.

Instructions:

The K98K (key default 4) is easy to operate and retains a good combat accuracy over fairly long ranges. With this in mind, aim the rifle down rage and fire a single shot in the same manner learned in the previous exercises. 

You will quickly notice that this weapon is extremely accurate. Obtaining successful kills at long ranges with the K98K can be easily achieved.

You will instinctively chamber a new round after each shot. If you would like to reload the internal box magazine with a fresh clip, press the 'reload' key at any time.  

Continue to aim, fire and reload the K98K until you feel comfortable with the weapon. 

When ready, move to the next station.

NOTE: In a later exercise, we will show you how to employ the rifle with a variable optic system using the 'alternate fire' mode.

Time Limit: None
