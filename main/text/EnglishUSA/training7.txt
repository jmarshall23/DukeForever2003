Exercise 7: Live-Fire Obstacle

This is a live-fire exercise intended to test your shock tolerance and to prepare you for the onslaught of hostile enemies. 

Instructions:

Crouch and move forward beneath the barbed wire. Continue moving forward until you have reached the end of the obstacle.

Once the live-fire portion of the exercise is completed take a moment to practice some of the skills you have learned. Follow the course beyond the dragon's teeth and through the drainage pipes until you reach the next station. 

Time Limit: None
