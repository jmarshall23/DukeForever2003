^8Part 1: Ice Station Norway^8

Your interrogation of the officer in the SWF has yielded the location of Deathshead's "X-Labs" in occupied Norway.  Our defecting SWF scientist has also revealed the nature of what is taking place at the "X-Labs"; project Uber Soldat, or Super Soldier.  This is Deathshead's most advanced technology project, apparently combining robotic and biological engineering to create the "ultimate killing machine".  By itself this Super Soldier could pose a considerable threat to the Allies, but it appears that this project may have some other connection to the SS Paranormal Division.  

In any event, the "X-Labs" must be infiltrated at all costs; we must know what Deathshead's ultimate goal is for these Super Soldiers, and, if possible, what their connection is to the SS Paranormal Division.
