My good friend and leader,
As I write you now I am filled with an indescribable mixture of joy and anticipation.  Here it is, the day, almost the very hour of our greatest triumph.  Destiny is now drawing us towards our appointment with the Anointed One, ushering us into a glorious new, Thousand Year Reich.

Do you remember the long years of our struggle?  The times when only you and I remained steadfast?  When only you and I would not be swayed from our purpose or our vision?  Think of all the fools who scoffed at us. The cowards who ridiculed us behind our backs.  To them I say - Let those laugh that win.  I believe we shall both be laughing very soon.

Your Servant
Marianna
