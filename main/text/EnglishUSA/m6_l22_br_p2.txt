^8Part 3: Chateau Schufstaffel^8

The "Anointing Ceremony" for the Super Soldiers is reported to be taking place somewhere near the chateau.  According to the Operation: Resurrection project book recovered from the "X-Labs", the three Super Soldiers are to be "anointed" by Marianna Blavatsky whereby they will be transformed into Dark Knights.  According to the project book the presence of these "Dark Knights" is necessary for the final phase of their plan; to raise Heinrich I from his 1000 year old burial site.  You must, if possible, stop the ceremony before it begins and destroy the Super Soldiers before their transformation.
