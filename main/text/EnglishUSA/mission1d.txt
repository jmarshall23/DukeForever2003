Things went sour after Agent One and I infiltrated the area.  Unable to meet our Kreisau Circle contacts, we were captured and taken to Castle Wolfenstein.  Agent One was tortured and killed, but revealed no information.  Overpowered guard and managed to escape.  Only way to Village was via Castle Wolfenstein Tram.  In Tram Station I finally managed to meet up with Kessler, who was badly wounded in a battle with Nazi guards.  Kessler spoke with High Command in Village, they all believe I am dead.  Proceeding on into Village with Kessler.
