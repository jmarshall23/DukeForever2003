^8Part 2: The Bombed Factory^8
 
The first part of the SWF industrial complex is the weapons factory.  Various aircraft and heavy weapons were being manufactured here before the bombing raid.  Intelligence has learned that this was also to be one of the manufacturing points for the Nazi's new "Venom" machine gun.  This weapon has been rumored to have an incredible rate of fire, and if it is half as powerful as reports would indicate could pose a serious threat to the Allies.

The defecting scientist has confirmed  the reports that there is a "Venom Gun" project book located somewhere in the factory which contains all of that weapon's technical information and specifications.
