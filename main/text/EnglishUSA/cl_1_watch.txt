Subject: Alert Status

As you are all aware, the SS Paranormal Division has had tremendous success in their recent archeological efforts near the village.  However, Oberst Helga von Bulow is extremely displeased with the level of security at Castle Wolfenstein and the village near the excavation sites.  I cannot stress how important this operation is to the Reich.

Two spies were recently discovered attempting to infiltrate the castle.  With this in mind I caution you; any breaches in security determined to be caused by watch personnel will be dealt with in the harshest manner possible.

Regards,
Major Wilhelm Jurgen
Security Officer, Castle Wolfenstein
