Debriefed Jack Stone at OSA by coded radio at Malta.   Airdropped in forest near SS rocket base at Katamarunde where I infiltrated the V2 Rocket Base through means of stealth approach.  Once inside base destroyed V2 with "dirty water" warhead aimed for London.  Fought through heavy resistance on way out to reach Experimental Aircraft Facility.  Successfully infiltrated Aircraft Facility, located launch directives and "appropriated" experimental Bachem-317 Kobra Rocket Plane.  Flew without incident back to Malta to turn over Kobra to OSA scientists.
