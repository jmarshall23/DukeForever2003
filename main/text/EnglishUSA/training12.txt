Exercise 12: The OSA Combat Knife and Kick attack

This exercise will teach you how to effectively use your OSA combat knife and teach you how to properly kick the enemy.

Instructions:

With your combat knife selected (key default 1), approach one of the canvas bags in front of you. While standing directly in front of the bag press the 'attack' key. If you have successfully inflicted damage upon the enemy the bag will swing.

From the same position you may also kick the enemy by pressing your 'kick' key. The kick attack often comes in handy when you have run out of ammunition and do not have enough time to draw your combat knife. 

When you are ready, move behind the bag and point your knife at the red 'X' that marks the enemy's spinal chord. The knife icon located at the bottom your screen will appear to signify that you are in position to strike a single, silent and deadly blow. 

Practice attacking the various canvas bags with these attack methods. When you are comfortable with your ability, proceed to the next station.

Time Limit: None
