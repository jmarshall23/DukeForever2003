To: All Tram Car Maintenance Supervisors
From: Deputy Reichsminister Ungeschickt

A recent investigation into the causes of tram car fatalities has uncovered a typographical error in the Quarterly Cable Tension Adjustment Procedure.  The following line, AN ALLOWABLE ERROR OF + OR - 500KG should now read AN ALLOWABLE ERROR OF + OR - 0.5KG.  It is believed that this correction will lead to a significant improvement in the future safety record of all military tram cars.
