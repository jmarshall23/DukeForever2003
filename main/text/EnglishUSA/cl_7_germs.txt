Subj:  Report on V Weapon Readiness

We have just completed the final testing of our Series III V Weapon.  I am pleased to report that the A9 rocket has proven more than sufficient for the delivery of a biological payload to London.  A shipment of the latest generation, mutated Bothrax D virus from my Germ Warfare Team in Norway is expected to arrive within four days.  Steiner assures me of full operational readiness by no later than the second week of April.

Respectfully yours
SS Oberfuhrer Wilhelm Strasse,  
Commanding Officer, Reich Special Projects
