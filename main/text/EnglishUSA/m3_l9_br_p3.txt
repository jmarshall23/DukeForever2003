The area is lightly guarded, but there are alarm stations scattered throughout.  If any alarms are sounded the base will be alerted and the mission will be scrubbed.  If you encounter any enemies, eliminate them before they can sound an alarm.  Remember: Do not eliminate the final guard who controls access into the compound; if you do, the supply truck will not be able to get inside the rocket base.
