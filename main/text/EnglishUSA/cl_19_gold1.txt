To: Major Jurgen
From: Secretary Giereg

I wish to call your attention to Reichsmarshall Directive 197 which explicitly states that all art treasures, artifacts, and miscellaneous valuables, acquired during wartime, are to be turned over to the Minister of the Interior (Reichsmarshall Goering) for proper disposition.  Be advised that any violation of this directive will be treated as a serious criminal offense.

Dieter Giereg,
Special Assistant to the Reichsmarshall,
Ministry of the Interior
