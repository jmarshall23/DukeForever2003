Your mission is to infiltrate Chateau Shufstaffel and stop this ceremony at all costs.  To reduce the chances of alerting the enemy, you will be air dropped near a dam two kilometers from Paderborn. You must cross the dam to reach Paderborn, and from there gain access to the chateau.  A silent approach is your best option.  Once in Paderborn you are to assassinate the Paranormal Division officers and discover the exact location of the ceremonies. Should you arrive too late, proceed with all speed to Castle Wolfenstein and ensure the "Resurrection" does not take place.
