Very little information was divulged by this subject.  He was subjected to 77% standard current before expiring.  We did discover a cyanide tablet hidden in a compartment of the subjects boot.  This discovery leads us to believe that he and his accomplice are allied spies, although we have not determined at this time which agency they may be working for.

I believe that I will achieve better results from his accomplice.
