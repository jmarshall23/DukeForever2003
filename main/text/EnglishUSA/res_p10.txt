               OPERATION RESURRECTION

Phase III:  Resurrection

Once imbued, the hosts will undergo a
'perfect transfiguration', becoming, in
substance, True Dark Knights.

Next comes the most crucial portion of the
ceremony.  Forming a circle with the newly
annointed Dark Knights, Madame Blavatsky
shall recite the most ancient 'Words of
Raising'.  These words, and the resulting
meta-psychic link, shall open a rift in
the earth, preparing the way for the
rebirth of The Master.
