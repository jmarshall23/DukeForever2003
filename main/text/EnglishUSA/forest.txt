^8MISSION 3: WEAPONS OF VENGEANCE^8

^8Part 1: Forest Compound^8

Deathshead has been tracked to a remote rocket base located near the Baltic Coast, where he intends to fire a V2 rocket at London fitted with some kind of new chemical warhead.  Your only viable method of infiltration is to stow away aboard a supply truck bound for the base.  You will parachute into the outlying forest area armed only with your knife and silenced Sten.  

The rest of your gear will be deployed separately in two drop containers.  In one of them you will find the new OSA M1S "Snooper" rifle which has been shown to be highly effective for long range, covert "wet work".  Due to the fact that this weapon uses very specialized ammunition, we can only issue you with a limited amount. Also, due to its experimental nature, it is imperative that you recover this item lest it fall into enemy hands.

The area is lightly guarded, but there are alarm stations scattered throughout.  If any alarms are sounded the base will be alerted and the mission will be scrubbed.  If you encounter any enemies, eliminate them before they can sound an alarm.  Remember: Do not eliminate the final guard who controls access into the compound; if you do, the supply truck will not be able to get inside the rocket base.
